For this you had to change the SWITCHCHAR parameter in config.sys. Paths used in this example document generally looked more like Linux paths instead of Windows. /dev/ could even be enabled. To this day, navigation with forward slashes is still possible as well (e.g. cd C:\ProgramData)
According to Larry Osterman (archived), a long-time Microsoft employee, the backslash was chosen because the normal slash was already occupied by IBM for command line options.</description></item></channel></rss>
